Simple guitar fretboard reader.

Loads a background image and uses the mouse move event to interpret the note.

This is not a complete program. It's my initial attempt with JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas. 
The main part here is the actual mouse position.  This can be seen in the showNote function.

The tool notes.htm is a web page that show all the relative notes of the cursor position.
